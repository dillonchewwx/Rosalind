# Rosalind Challenge - Bionformatics

[Rosalind](www.rosalind.info) is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving. Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity; each problem is checked automatically, so that the only resource required to learn bioinformatics is an internet connection.

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges on the website.
